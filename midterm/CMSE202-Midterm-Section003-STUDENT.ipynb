    "# CMSE 202 Midterm (Section 003 - Fall 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll practice setting up a GitHub repository, committing and pushing repository changes, downloading data with command line tools, performing some data analysis, possibly using a new Python package, and writing a python class. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 202 under your belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. Once you've read through it, try doing Parts 0 and 1 first so that you have your repository set up and you download all necessary data files as they will be necessary to complete the assigned tasks. Let your instructor know right away if you have problems downloading the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is set up so that even if you get stuck on one part there are opportunities to get points on the other parts, so consider jumping ahead if you feel like you aren't making progress and then come back later if you have time. If you have any questions during the exam, you may ask the instructor, the TA, or the LA privately: simply raise your hand and one of us will come over to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However: The use of any person-to-person communication software or generative AI tools is absolutely not acceptable.** If you are seen accessing your email, using a collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Slack, Google Documents), or generative AIs (e.g. ChatGPT), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam, and triggering an Academic Dishonesty Report (ADR). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your eyes on your screen!** Unfortunately, there isn't enough space in the room for everyone to sit at their own table so please do your best to keep your eyes on your own screen. This exam is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero, and prompting an ADR for the incident. "
